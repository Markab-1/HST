    "text": "Our first immediate objective (Run 1) is to detect the Ti II &lambda; 3242, 3384, and 3230 lines in the \
            ighest resolution UVES spectra of 33 bright MW OB-type stars. For this we will use the Blue Arm \
            at the bluest setting (346 nm) and narrowest slit (0.4”, R &bsim; 70,000). We aim at studying the \
            individual components of the line profiles and characterise well their column densities.\
            To compensate for any differences in resolution we will use the highest resolution spectra \
            to determine the absorption-line profile decomposition and apply it to the lower-resolution data.\
            We also aim at covering the full spectrum by adding one UVES setting (Run2). This will further enable the detection \
            of a wide variety of atomic and molecular lines (in the cold neutral medium) that are useful for both abundance and \
            depletion studies, as well as characterizing the physical conditions of the gas. The combination of the 346+580 \
            and 437+760 settings will cover the Fe I &lambda;3720 line, the Ca II H & K lines, Na I D lines, K i λ 7664, 7698 lines, \
            many diffuse interstellar bands, and molecular lines (OH, CH, CH+ , CN, C2 , C3 ), among others. Last, but not \
            least, covering the full spectrum, specially between 3800 and 9000Å, is key to characterise the spectral features \
            that are necessary, together with the UV, for the determination of the OB stellar metallicities (e.g. Simon-Diaz \
            2020). We aim at measuring and comparing the metallicities of the 33 OB stars and the ISM toward them. \
            Beyond these immediate objectives, the proposed observations, combining high-resolution UV and optical spectra, \
            will build a dataset of great legacy for the study of both the ISM (in different phases) and massive stars."
